This is an implementation of the k hop2token transformer which is used for node classification.

Moreover, one can find node poisoning attacks on the dataset. I showed in the paper that it outperforms models if you consider DICE attacks and train your model on that. One can see the results in folder.

data folder is Pubmed and Coda and Citeseer datasets.
